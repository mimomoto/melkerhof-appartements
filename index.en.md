<h1>Welcome to the historic centre of Vienna!</h1>
</div>

Surrounded by the old city walls on the street of Mölkerbastei, situated between
the University, Burgtheater, City Hall, the Minoritenkirche and Schottenkirche
churches and Freyung square, our apartments are located in the
Baroque [Melker Hof](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melker_Hof).
The building consists of 4 inner courtyards
dating from 1631 and houses the [Melker Stiftskeller](http://www.melkerstiftskeller.at/) restaurant,
the [Restaurant Schubert mediterran](http://www.restaurant-schubert.at/) and the renowned traditional
dress shop [Tostmann](http://www.tostmann.at/).

A gem of the Melker Hof is our little self-contained, two-storey townhouse,
which lies in an extremely peaceful location away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The Vienna State Opera, St. Stephen’s Cathedral, the Art History Museum and the
Natural History Museum, MuseumsQuartier as well as the Albertina are within comfortable walking distance.

Belvedere Palace, Schönbrunn Palace as well as the popular wine taverns in Grinzing
can be easily reached from nearby Schottentor.
